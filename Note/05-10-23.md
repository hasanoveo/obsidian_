##### vStorage Volumes affected by incident – 92 minutes unavailable
### Infrastructure Uptime Calculations  
#### vStorage Uptime  
Cloud Uptime % = [(44640-92) / 44640] *100 = 99.79%

Where:  
Minutes in the Month of October = 60 minutes *24 hours*31 days = 44640 min Downtime minutes for vStorage = 92 mins  
Cloud Uptime = 99.79%  
Note: Cloud Uptime % = [(Minutes in the Month – Downtime) / Minutes in Month] X 100

#### Compute Uptime (vCPU, vRAM)

#### Cloud Uptime % = [(44640-10) / 44640] *100 = 99.98%

Where:  
Minutes in the Month of October = 60 minutes *24 hours*31 days = 44640 min Downtime minutes for Compute (vCPU, vRAM) resources = 10 mins  
Cloud Uptime = 99.98%  
Note: Cloud Uptime % = [(Minutes in the Month – Downtime) / Minutes in Month] X 100
