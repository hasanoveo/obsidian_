Hope you are well!

The test environment is already completed for you. I have sent activation emails to you and Aydan for now. If anyone else should be activated for the testing environment, please let me know.

**Password: You should receive activation email to set-up your password.**

Please test the following:

- Team’s hierarchy,
- Team’s assignment,
- Team’s Managers,
- Sync with your data warehouse (for example: change team assignment for a user, change team manager, change parent team, change name of the team – after that please check if every change is reflected in the system). 

As we are not able to access your data warehouse and perform the thorough integration testing, we would appreciate your help with this.

Once the testing is completed and you are happy with the results, the integration will be released to the production Pasha Bank environment, SSO will be turned on and you will be ready to go-live with the system.

Please let me know in case of any questions or concerns.

Many thanks,

Angelika
