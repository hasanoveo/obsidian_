Dear colleagues,

As know, on November 19 during the BCP testing, we encountered issues: we were unable to restore servers on the GDRS side using SRM (the problems occurred within the Servers SRE scope)

This is very serious problem for the bank, as it poses a risk that in emergency situations, we cannot be certain that all our systems, which we planned to operate in GDRS, will work correctly.

For this reason, we urgent request you to provide us with the RFO document concerning the incident that occurred on November 19 during the BCP test.
